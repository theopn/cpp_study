# My C++ Study

C++ Study with [Learn CPP dot com](https://www.learncpp.com).

- I have a previous coding experience with C, so many core ideas are skipped in notes and example codes; stuff in the notes are things that interested me
- Notes taken with Vimwiki
- `playground.cpp` and `Makefile` in the Git directory is just me playing around
